## The Purpose
To showcase myself to potential employers

## Functionality & features
My website has an easy to find easy to use menu at the top of the page. Pages are both fluid and responsive.
I've utilised both flexbox and grid to organise my layout. My theme takes advantage of shadowing dark and light to make text pop. Plenty of images throughout the site, most of which come from my phone so they're 100% oringinal all credit to other photos found in the footer.
